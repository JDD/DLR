Introduction to DLR
-------------------------

Things you need to do as soon as you join DLR:
!pref password=xxx - Do this in PM with DLR, this will allow you to use !letmein if P is down.

!pref planet=x:y:z - This will allow DLR to use your co ords for things such as !lookup, !xp, !basher etc.

!pref phone=#### - Will add your phone-number to DLR.

!pref pubphone=(T/F) - Toggles whether your phone number is public or private.
!phone allow/deny <nick> - Allows you to create a list of people who can see your phone number even when it is private.

Different prefixes (!lookup, -lookup, @lookup):
~, - or . - DLR will notice you the response
@ - DLR will PM you the response
! - DLR will respond in the channel

Try not to use ! in public to prevent spamming the channel

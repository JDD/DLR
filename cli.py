"""
This module is intended for command-line testing.

Usage:
When running the program, the argv is used as a prefix
for every line sent to the bot, and the output is
written to stdout. That's to say, if I call the program like this:
./cli.py :qebab!qebab@qebab.users.netgamers.org PRIVMSG #ascendancy :
./cli.py :ell!ellonweb@ellonweb.users.netgamers.org PRIVMSG #ascendancy :
It will hang on stdin for input, and when it gets a line it will concatenate
the input with this, so that for instance:
./cli.py :qebab!qebab@qebab.users.netgamers.org PRIVMSG #ascendancy :
> !eff 3k harpy
The line is run as though it was:
:qebab!qebab@qebab.users.netgamers.org PRIVMSG #ascendancy :!eff 3k harpy

Once running, you might need to run these two commands:
!debug M.CUT.Channels['#ascendancy'] = M.CUT.Channel('#ascendancy')
!debug M.CUT.Channels['#ascendancy'].addnick(message.get_nick())
